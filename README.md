### Step 1: Use This Template

1. Click on the "Use this template" button.
2. Create a new repository. Name it anything you like, `docs` is a common naming choice.

### Step 2: Open in Your Preferred IDE

Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor.

### Step 3: Customize Organization Name

In the fern.config.json file, replace the placeholder organization name with your actual organization name. For example:

```json
{
    "organization": "YourOrganization",
    "version": "0.15.0"
}
```

Also, in the docs.yml file, update the docs URL to match your organization's naming convention. For example:

```yml
instances:
  - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
```

### Step 4: Generate Your Documentation

1. Install the Fern CLI by running:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

2. Generate your documentation with the following command:

```bash
fern generate --docs
```

You will be prompted to log in and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, you will receive a URL where your documentation is published. For example:

```text
â”Œâ”€
â”‚ âœ“  your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
â””â”€
```

### Step 5: Customize Your Documentation 

To get started, replace the provided OpenAPI specification with your own. Then, modify the markdown pages located in the [content](fern/docs/content/) directory. You can further tailor your documentation to match your brand by adjusting settings in the [docs.yml](fern/docs.yml) file.


### Step 6: Set Up a Custom Domain 

If you wish to use a custom domain like `docs.your-organization.com` or a subdirectory like `your-organization.com/docs`, you can subscribe to the [Starter plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing). Once subscribed, update [docs.yml](fern/docs.yml) with the custom domain configuration:

``` yaml
 - url: your-organization.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.your-organization.com
```
